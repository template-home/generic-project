## About 

Behind every github repository there is an idea that should be shared but sometimes is not easy to explain it. This repository serves as a super generic template so you can explain your ideas.

It uses format ideas from several great github projects, like using badges to comunicate project status, the use of single line indexes, images, animations and emoticons!
