## About 

Behind every github repository there is an idea that should be shared but sometimes is not easy to explain it. This repository serves as a super generic template so you can explain your ideas.

It uses format ideas from several great github projects, like using badges to comunicate project status, the use of single line indexes, images, animations and emoticons!
	
## Features `(optional)`

Some projects might have several resources (documents, images, code...) so it is important to present this in a simple list. 

This template contains the following features:

- This `readme` file that serves as simple and padronized way of explain your projects.

- A `LICENSE` file example to explain others how they can use the project.

## Usage

Every public project can be reused in different ways, so its nice to explain to the others. This project can be used in two ways: to create a new [project](#project) and to create new templates.

### Project

- Select the `Use this template` button that appears on the project menu or use [this link](https://github.com/template-home/generic-project/generate).

- Give your new project a name, a short description and choose if it will be public or private. You can change all this later.

### Template

- Follow the same steps for creating a new project

- Access the settings menu on the new project

- Check the option `Template repository` that appears below the repository name


## Contribute

There are several ways of helping any project:

- Using the project

- Sharing with your friends

- Creating questions or alerting about some problem or bug trhough the issues function

- Making a fork and creating pull requests

> Contributions are always welcome! ðŸŽ‰ 

## Credits 

All projects are a colletive work and its crucial to give credit to all contributors even the indirect ones.

A good way of doing it is listing the names with links to their profiles on github or other plataforms. This way they can be found by hiring people.
